### _Not using Laradock_ 

I hope this is not used against me, but I have decided not to use Laradock and to roll out my own Docker config(s) to suit the stack I want to build. Laradock is great, especially for beginners, however I find that it's too bloated and heavy, especially when working on an older Macbook Air with limited storage and resources. 

By rolling out my own setup, I am able to key my configs lean and only use the best parts that I require. On the bright side, it goes that show that I am comfortable enough using Docker to roll out my own config.
